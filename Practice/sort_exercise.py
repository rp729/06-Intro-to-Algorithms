1. Which configuration of data in a list causes the smallest number of exchanges
in a selection sort? Which configuration of data causes the largest number of
exchanges?

Ascending vs descending order. Smallest to largest doesn't have to do sh*t

 2. Explain the role that the number of data exchanges plays in the analysis of
 selection sort and bubble sort. What role, if any, does the size of the data
 objects play?

 Bubble sort has a bubble effect on the desired product. Selection sort iters through each item in
 a list to find the desired product.The more data there is the more sets that will need to be
 compared.

 3. Explain why the modified bubble sort still exhibits O(n^2) behavior on average.

 

 4. Explain why insertion sort works well on partially sorted lists.
 Insertion sort is good for partially sorted lists due to the inner loop
