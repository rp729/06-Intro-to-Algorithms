1. Assume that each of the following expressions indicates the number of
operations performed by an algorithm for a problem size of n. Point out
the dominant term of each algorithm and use big-O notation to classify it.

    a. 2^n - 4n^2 + 5n
       O(2^n)

    b. 3n^2 + 6
       O(n^2)

    c. n^3 + n^2 - n
       O(n^3)
