Algorithm - Describes a computation process that halts with a solution
            to a problem.

            There are many criteria for assessing the quality of an algorithm.
            The most essential cireterion is correctness, it actually solves the
            problem it's meant to solve. Readability and ease of maintenance
            are also important qualities. Run-time performance is one of the most
            important qualities.


Benchmarking - measure the time cost of an algorithm to obtain an actual run time.


Counting - Another technique used to estimate the efficiency of an algorithm
           with different problem sizes. Keep in mind you are counting the
           instructions in the high-level code in which the algorithm is written,
           not instructions in the executable machine language program.
