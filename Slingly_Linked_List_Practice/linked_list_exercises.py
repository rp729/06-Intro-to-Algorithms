Core Exercises:

    1. Finish out your doubly and circular linked list to add more functionality
        - prepend
        - insert
        - delete
        - print

    2. Implement a swap_node method to singly and doubly.

    3. Implement a reverse method to singly and doubly.

    4. Modify delete to find the data you want to delete rather than an index.
        Modify delete to take in either an index or data.

    5. Implement a count_ocurrences method.

    6. Create a new file and modify your code to have DoublyLinkedList inherit from your 
        SinglyLinkedList class.

Extras Exercises:

    7. Define a length function that returns the number of items in your linked structure.

    8. Define a function makeDoubly that expects a singly linked structure as its argument. The 
        function builds and returns a doubly linked structure that contains the items in the singly
        linked structure.
